## Notes
- Setup mode does not burn quota.
- Salesforce connectors are a premium add-on.
- Retention tiers scale storage costs.

## Optional AI Rollups Add-on (Recommendation)
- Keep current core pricing unchanged.
- Offer AI rollups as an optional add-on or tier gate for workspaces that enable `use_llm_rollups`.
- Suggested guardrails for add-on packaging:
  - include monthly LLM-run allowance,
  - overage visibility via token/latency metrics,
  - policy defaults to `structured_only` for data minimization.
